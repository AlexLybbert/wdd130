        <p>My name is Alex. For the last year and a half I have been traveling around the US in a fifth wheel trailer
            with my wife
            and 3 boys (10, 7, 6). I work remotely as a software developer and I decided I should get a formal education
            in software
            development since I was self taught. I love all things plant related. My wife and I have about 75 plants in
            our trailer.
            I love the Savior and I would be so lost without Him and his teachings.</p>

        <p>I currently live in the beautiful state of Utah. It is home to mountains, rivers, lakes, and good people. You
            are never far from a grand adventure in Utah.</p>
